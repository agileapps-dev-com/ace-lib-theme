# Theming your ace-lib components
## What is an 'ace-lib-theme'?
A 'ace-lib-theme' is the set of colors and typography definitions that will be applied on the ace-lib components. Using ace-lib-theme package, you can customize the color and typography of the ace-lib components. 

An ace-lib-theme package contains the core `scss` files which are used to create a theme. These `scss` files needs to be compiled as `css`.


## Creating a custom theme
You can create a theme file using the provided SCSS files in `ace-lib-theme` pacakge. The package contains `assets/scss` directory which contians all the Sass files used to build a theme css file. Once the scss files are changed, use the [node-sass](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-sass) commands to complie them into css. 

Follow the below steps to create an `ace-lib-theme`.

### 1. Install the ace-lib-theme package.

Install the 'ace-lib-theme` from the npm package manager using the below command:

```javascript
npm i ace-lib-theme
```


### 2. Copy the sass files 

Copy the `scss` directory from `node_modules/ace-lib-theme/assets/` into the cui template's `assets/themes/` directory. If you need information about how to create a cui-template, refer to the [cui-template](https://github.com/agileapps-dev-com/agileapps-cui) documentation.

### 3. Make the necessary changes to the `scss` files

Make changes to the scss files as required and then compile the scss files into `ace-theme.css`. [Understand the structure of the scss files](#understanding-the-structure-of-ace-lib-theme-theme) from below.

>**Note:** It's highly recommended to retain the scss files and directory structure as it is. Use `_add-on-styles.scss` for your custom additional css style definitions.

### 4. Compile the `scss` files into `css`
Use the below `node-sass` command to compile the scss files into the theme css file :

>**Important Note:** If you have not installed the `node-sass` package globally, you will need to install it, before you use the below command. Use `npm i node-sass -g` to install it.

```javascript
node-sass -c ~path\to\scss -o ~path\to\generated\css\
```
> **Note:** The above command will complile the `ace-theme.scss` file into `ace-theme.css`

### 5. Use the `ace-theme.css` into the template's `index.html`
The generated css theme file should be linked to the template html file.

```html
<link href="~path/to/generated/css/ace-theme.css" rel="stylesheet">
```

## Understanding the structure of `ace-lib-theme` theme
The root directory of scss file contains the below important files:

```scss
\---scss
    |   ace-theme.scss
    |   _add-on-styles.scss
    |   _colors.scss
    |   _typography.scss
    |   
    +---components
    |   |   
    |   +---ace-elements
    |   |           
    |   +---common               
    \---utilities
```

| File/Directory | Description |
| -------------- |------------ |
| ace-theme.scss    | The main scss file. It imports all other internal scss files. |
| _add-on-styles.scss    | The scss file which contains the your addtional customizations. Any additional css definitions or customizations are to be part of this file. |

## Using the pre-built sample themes
`ace-lib-theme` package contains some pre-built sample theme files. You can use them directly importing into your cui template project. You can use the below options to include. 

>**Note:** You will need to update the path to `node_modules` directory in the below reference code.

1. Using css import:
```javascript
@import 'node_modules/ace-lib-theme/examples/css/blue-green/ace-theme.min.css' ;
```
2. Directly referencing the file in the html:
```html
